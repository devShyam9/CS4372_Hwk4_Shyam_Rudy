=== Summary 1 ===
Valancy Stirling's whole life would have been entirely different if it had not rained on a certain May morning. She would have gone, with the rest of her clan, to Aunt Wellington’s engagement picnic. But it did rain and you shall hear what happened to her because of it.

=== Summary 2 ===
Valancy had never quite relinquished a certain pitiful, shamed, little hope that Romance would come her way yet. The tears came into her eyes as she lay there alone in the faintly greying darkness. She dared not let herself cry as hard as she wanted to. She was afraid that crying might bring on another attack of that pain around the heart.

=== Summary 3 ===
“I answered with the plain truth, ‘I am crying because I cannot get married’ How horrified Mother would be,” Valancy thought. “It is not,’ Valancy could hear her mother’s prim, dictatorial voice asserting, “it is not _maidenly_ to think about _men_.”

=== Summary 4 ===
Valancy hated the picture of a puppy sitting on a rainy doorstep. The other picture was a faded, passe-partouted engraving of Queen Louise coming down a stairway. Mother and Cousin Stickles would have been happy with the old photographs of ancient relatives long banished from the rooms below.

=== Summary 5 ===
Valancy was never permitted to stay alone in her room for any other purpose. The only thing Valancy liked about her room was that she could be alone there at night to cry if she wanted to. But, after all, what did it matter if a room, which you used for nothing except sleeping and dressing in, were ugly?

=== Summary 6 ===
Valancy had lived spiritually in the Blue Castle ever since she could remember. She had been a very tiny child when she found herself possessed of it. Nobody in the Stirling clan, or its ramifications, suspected this, least of all her mother and Cousin Stickles. They never knew that Valancy had two homes—the ugly red brick box of a home, on Elm Street, and the Blue castle in Spain.

=== Summary 7 ===
Most, if not all, of the Stirlings would have died of horror if they had known half the things Valancy did in her Blue Castle. For one thing she had quite a few lovers in it. Oh, only one at a time. One who wooed her with all the romantic ardour of the age of chivalry.

=== Summary 8 ===
The moment when a woman realises that she has nothing to live for—neither love, duty, purpose nor hope—holds for her the bitterness of death. “And I just have to go on living because I can’t stop. I may have to live eighty years,” thought Valancy, in a kind of panic.

=== Summary 9 ===
Valancy knew exactly what every one would say to her at the picnic. She would have to look as pleased and interested as if the dress and letter had been hers or else Aunt Wellington would be offended. Valancy had long ago decided that she would rather offend God than Aunt Wellington, because God might forgive her but Aunt Wellington never would.

=== Summary 10 ===
Valancy Stirling had been a great beauty in her youth. She was counted the prettiest girl in Canada. Only male creature in the world, who could never forget that. Uncle Herbert would remark jocularly, “How fat you’re getting, Doss!” And then everybody would laugh.

=== Summary 11 ===
Uncle Benjamin was a wealthy and childless old widower and Valancy had been brought up in the fear and admonition of his money. If she offended him he would cut her out of his will. Valancy did not want to be cut out of Uncle Benjamin’s will. She had been poor all her life and knew the galling bitterness of it.

=== Summary 12 ===
Valancy knew exactly what the picnic would be like and she blessed the rain that had saved her from it. There would be no packing up of teaspoons. The packing up was always left for Valancy and Cousin Stickles. Valancy never heard the last of that silver teaspoon. Its ghost appeared Banquo-like at every subsequent family feast.

=== Summary 13 ===
Valancy was never allowed to read novels, but John Foster’s books were not novels. They were “nature books”—so the librarian told Mrs. Frederick Stirling—“all about the woods and birds and bugs and things like that, you know.” So Valancy wasallowed to read them under protest, for it was only too evident that she enjoyed them too much.

=== Summary 14 ===
John Foster’s magic was indefinable. Valancy didn’t know whether she cared much for bugs either. She could hardly say what it was—some tantalising lure of a mystery never revealed. It was a month since she had _Thistle Harvest_, so surely Mother would get a new Foster book.

=== Summary 15 ===
Valancy Stirling had palpitations and shortness of breath. She almost thought she would go and see Dr. Trent about that queer pain around the heart. But could she go to see him without telling any one? It was a most daring thought. None of the Stirlings ever consulted a doctor without holding a family council and getting Uncle James' approval.

=== Summary 16 ===
Valancy felt that she couldn't tell anybody unless she had to. She felt quite sure there was nothing at all seriously wrong with her heart and no need of all the pother that would ensue if she mentioned it. She would just slip up quietly and see Dr. Trent that very day. She had the two hundred dollars that her father had put in the bank for her the day she was born.

=== Summary 17 ===
Dr. Trent was over seventy and there had been rumours that he meant to retire soon. None of the Stirling clan had ever gone to him since he had told Cousin Gladys, ten years before, that her neuritis was all imaginary and that she enjoyed it. You couldn’t patronise a doctor who insulted your first-cousin-once-removed like that.

=== Summary 18 ===
Valancy Stirling was born on a cold May morning. Her mother, Mrs. Frederick Stirling, made it a rule that no fires were necessary after the twenty-fourth of May. Meals were cooked on the little oil-stove in the back porch. No excuses for being late were ever tolerated in the Stirling household.

=== Summary 19 ===
Valancy lighted the light the next day, but it was a day too late for Frederick Stirling. Valancy took off and hung up in the closet her nightdress of coarse, unbleached cotton. She put on undergarments of a similar nature, a dress of brown gingham, thick, black stockings.

=== Summary 20 ===
Valancy had a small, pale mouth that always fell open a trifle over little, pointed white teeth. She had somehow escaped the family high cheek-bones, and her dark-brown eyes, too soft and shadowy to be black, had a slant that was almost Oriental. Apart from her eyes she was neither pretty nor ugly—just insignificant-looking, she concluded bitterly.

=== Summary 21 ===
All her life she had been afraid of something, she thought bitterly.  Afraid of her mother’s sulky fits,afraid of offending Uncle Benjamin. Only in her Blue Castle could she find temporary release. And this morning Valancy could not believe she had a Blue Castle.

=== Summary 22 ===
Blue Castle? She would cut such childish nonsense out of her life forever and face reality unflinchingly. The ugliness of the view always struck her like a blow; the ragged fence, the tumble-down old carriage-shop in the next lot, plastered with crude, violently coloured advertisements.

=== Summary 23 ===
Valancy hated marmalade, too. matter to Valancy. The chilly, gloomy little dining-room was chillier and gloomier than usual. The rain streamed down outside the window; departed Stirlings, in atrocious, gilt frames, glowered down from the walls. And yet Cousin Stickles wished Valancy many happy returns of the day!

=== Summary 24 ===
Valancy Jane Doss. had mumps—or whooping cough—or chicken-pox—or measles—or anything she should have had—nothing but horrible colds every winter. Doss’ winter colds were a sort of tradition in the family. Nothing, it seemed, could prevent her from catching them.

=== Summary 25 ===
Valancy was always a wonder that the Stirlings had allowed her to be so christened. She had been told that her maternal grandfather, old Amos Wansbarra, had chosen the name for her. Her father had tacked on the Jane by way of civilising it, and the whole connection got out of the difficulty by nicknaming her Doss.

=== Summary 26 ===
Cousin Stickles had once been desirable in some man’s eyes. Mrs. Frederick, except for those terrible glasses and the hooked nose that made her look more like a parrot than a parrots itself could look, was not ill-looking. At twenty she might have been quite pretty. And yet Cousin stickles was necessary to Mrs.Frederick.

=== Summary 27 ===
The house was full of quilts. There were three big chests, packed with quilts, in the attic. Mrs. Frederick had begun storing away quilts when Valancy was seventeen. She kept on storing them, though it did not seem likely that Valancy would ever need them.

=== Summary 28 ===
It is of no use to seek the woods from any motive except sheer love of them. They will find us out at once and hide all their sweet, old-world secrets from us. We must go to them lovingly, humbly, patiently, watchfully, and we shall learn what poignant loveliness lurks in the wild places.

=== Summary 29 ===
Valancy dropped the book like a hot coal and fled downstairs to her patches. She felt the strange exhilaration of spirit that always came momentarily to her when she dipped into one of John Foster’s books. Valancy did not know much about woods—except the haunted groves of oak and pine around her Blue Castle.

=== Summary 30 ===
“Of what value is my time?” asked Valancy bitterly. “Doss! Don’t speak in that tone to _me_.” “We need some tea,” said Cousin Stickles. � “She might go and get that if she wants a walk—though this damp weather is bad for colds”
